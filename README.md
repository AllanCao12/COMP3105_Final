A CNN that is designed to take an input of 3 MNIST images as input, with all 3 stacked on top of each other. Then, depending on if the top one is even or odd, pick one of the two digits below. 

Many of the design choices are simply what I found to be the standard and they happened to work in this case. I was ready to fine-tune some of the hyper-parameters had I needed to but luckily I didn't.
